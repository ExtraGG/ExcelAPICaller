## Description
This subroutine will perform four API Calls to get the value in â‚¬ of the last trade that occurred at Kraken of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ethereum classic and Litecoin in Microsoft Excel. These values are then passed to several cells in the sheet 'Cryptocurrency values'. It is easily extendable to include other cryptocurrencies or API Calls to other websites. 

## Installation 
Both options yield the same end result.

#### Option 1:
When using the .xlsm file:
Accept all security prompts. Press Ctrl + L to refresh the values when inside your workbook.

#### Option 2:
If you do not wish to use the .xlsm file you can implement the code yourself from the ExcelAPI.bas file. You need the [developer tab](https://msdn.microsoft.com/nl-nl/library/bb608625.aspx) to access Microsoft Excel's Visual Basic functionality.

- [x] Enable Microsoft scripting Runtime reference. When inside a module in Visual Basic, click on Tools -> References, scroll down to select Microsoft Scripting Runtime and press 'OK'.

- You also need to download and import the JsonConverter module. This can be retrieved [here](https://github.com/VBA-tools/VBA-JSON).

You can link the macro to a shortcut if you want by adding a shortcut at Developer tab -> Macro's -> Edit.
